# Drug-Persistent-Non-Persistent-SVM-Model
The primary purpose of this model is to categorize patients into two distinct groups: persistent and non-persistent. The "persistent" group includes patients who are anticipated to continue with their prescribed drug therapy, while the "non-persistent" group comprises patients who are likely to discontinue or stop the treatment.
